Wouldn't it be cool if you could sum up total installs in the Google Play Developer console?

Introducing google-play-totalizer. 

## Why?

The new and imrpoved Google Play Console has lots of [Material goodness](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/19/new-google-play-console-brings-developer-management-material-era/), but is still missing some useful stuff. 

The table listing apps on the All Applications page doesn't include a summation of total sales, total installs, and/or total revenue across all apps - this makes me sad.

**google-play-totalizer** sums these up in a super simple little popover:

As you might expect, it'll exlude "Free" apps from the total revenue result.

## Usage?

Once installed, visit the Google Play Console and click the Totalizer icon. All going well, you'll get the totalized goodness.
